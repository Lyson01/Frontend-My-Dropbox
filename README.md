# Getting Started with Create React App
Welcome to the Dropbox project! This project aims to provide a seamless file-sharing and storage solution for individuals and teams.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
- Upload files securely to the cloud.
- Share files and folders with others via links or invites.
- Sync files across multiple devices.
- Collaborate in real-time on documents.


## Getting Started
To get started with the Dropbox project, follow these steps:

1. **Sign Up/Login**: If you haven't already, sign up for a Dropbox account or log in to your existing account.

2. **Install the Dropbox App**: Download and install the Dropbox app on your device(s) from [the Dropbox website](https://www.dropbox.com/install).

3. **Setup**: Follow the on-screen instructions to set up your Dropbox account and configure any preferences.

4. **Upload Files**: Start uploading your files to Dropbox by either dragging and dropping them into the app or using the upload button.

5. **Share Files**: Share files or folders with others by generating a share link or sending invites directly from the Dropbox app or website.

6. **Sync**: Enable sync on your devices to ensure that your files are always up to date across all your devices.


## Usage
Here are some tips for using Dropbox effectively:

- Organize your files into folders to keep them structured and easily accessible.
- Use the search functionality to quickly find specific files or folders.
- Take advantage of version history to revert to previous versions of files if needed.
- Collaborate with others by creating shared folders or using Dropbox Paper for collaborative document editing.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
